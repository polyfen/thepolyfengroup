  <p>Our culture is built around R&D and the incubation of digital products that maximise efficiency in our workflows and maintain us in the leading-edge of the industry.</p>
  <p>The most significant brand we operate is <strong><a data-before="plfn" href="https://polyfen.com" target="_blank" rel="follow">Polyfen</a></strong>. A software & creative studio offering engineering, design, and marketing services for US businesses.</p>
  <p>The company was founded on March 23rd, 2018 by art director, product designer <a data-before="bh" href="https://boris.hr" target="_blank">Boris Hrn&ccaron;i&cacute;</a>. Since then, the business incorporated new partners and has grown into a thriving team.</p>
  <p>Our location-independent business model takes advantage of the latest tech to work seamlessly with a fully-remote team years before the Covid pandemic made it the new normal.</p>
