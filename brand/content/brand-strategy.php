    <h4 class="heading-3 align-center" style="max-width:500px;margin:0 auto;padding-top:0;">Where business & creativity come together</h4>
</div>
<p>Similar to the Keywords, but more expressive and distinctive, the Creative Concept is a word or phrase that represents the desired emotional response from the target public when interacting with the Brand.</p>
<p>Unlike a Slogan, a Creative Concept is not necessarily developed for public use, although it can be used publicly. Its primary purpose is to be used internally as a mantra to guide the creative process when sketching a Logo, copywriting a slogan, designing an ad, or when developing any other type of Brand Communication. This ensures that all elements of the Brand will convey a consistent message.</p>
<h3 id="moodboard" class="heading-2">3.3. Moodboard</h3>
<img src="imgs/moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard" height="auto" width="100%">
<p>The Moodboard contains a collection of images the can be associated with the industry and the lifestyle of the target audience. It helps identify different colours and shapes with the aim of narrowing down a certain direction for the look-and-feel of the brand.</p>
<h3 id="naming" class="heading-2">3.4. Naming</h3>
<h4 id="etymology" class="heading-3">Etymology</h4>
<p>"Polyfen" is an abstraction of the term “Polyphenic trait”. A polyphenic trait is a genetic property that allows multiple observable variations on organisms of a single species.</p>

<h3 id="voice" class="heading-2">3.6. Voice</h3>
<p>The content expressed by our brand must be informative and engaging, proactive in the design and development community with free and fully-accessible educational content in tutorials and open-source software.</p>
<h4 id="newsletter" class="heading-3">3.6.1. Newsletter</h4>
<p>The Newsletter is the holy grail of our content strategy. It allows us to focus on short-form content delivered directly to our subscribers in their inbox.</p>
<p>Most Blogs out there demand a lot of resources to end up with a very long, elaborate, polished post, that none or very few people read in full. Our Newsletter prioritizes an efficient content creation workflow that results in easily degistible content published frequently and consistently.</p>
<p>The content produced for the Newsletter is repurposed in two ways. (A) as Social Media posts in LinkedIn, and (B) kept in an online archive as a page in <a data-before="plfn" href="https://polyfen.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">Polyfen's</a> website.</p>
