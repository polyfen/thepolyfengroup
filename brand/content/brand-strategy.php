<h3 class="heading-2">3.1. Voice</h3>

<h3 class="heading-2">3.4. Creative Concept</h3>
<h4 class="heading-3">Where business & creativity come together</h4>
<p>Similar to the Keywords, but more expressive and distinctive, the Creative Concept is a word or phrase that represents the desired emotional response from the target public when interacting with the Brand.</p>
<p>Unlike a Slogan, a Creative Concept is not necessarily developed for public use, although it can be used publicly. Its primary purpose is to be used internally as a mantra to guide the creative process when sketching a Logo, copywriting a slogan, designing an ad, or when developing any other type of Brand Communication. This ensures that all elements of the Brand will convey a consistent message.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">3.5. Moodboard</h3>
<p>The Moodboard contains a collection of images the can be associated with the industry and the lifestyle of the target audience. It helps identify different colours and shapes with the aim of narrowing down a certain direction for the look-and-feel of the brand.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">3.6. Naming</h3>
<h4 class="heading-3">3.6.1. Etymology</h4>
<p>"Polyfen" comes from an abstraction of the term “Polyphenic trait”. A polyphenic trait is a genetic property that allows multiple observable variations on organisms of a single species.</p>
<p>The different morphology and color patterns on the shells of mollusks, for instance, are a polyphenic trait.</p>
