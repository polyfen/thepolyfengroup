<h2 class="heading-1">7. Content Generation</h2>
<p>The subject matter of all content generation must be relevant, congruent with our <a href="#voice" data-emoji="anchor">Voice</a> and <a href="#tone" data-emoji="anchor">Tone</a>, and in touch with reality. We don't want to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="reddit.com/r/linkedinlunatics" data-emoji="link">r/LinkedInLunatics</a>. We aim to publish content frequently, yes; But, never at the expense of quality.</p>
<h3 id="newsletter" class="heading-2">7.1. Newsletter</h3>
<p>The Newsletter is the holy grail of our content strategy. It allows us to focus on short-form content delivered directly to our subscribers in their inbox.</p>
<p>Most Blogs out there demand a lot of resources to end up with a very long, elaborate, polished post, that none or very few people read in full. Our Newsletter prioritizes an efficient content creation workflow that results in easily degistible content published frequently and consistently.</p>
<p>The content produced for the Newsletter is repurposed in two ways. (A) as Social Media posts in LinkedIn, and (B) kept in an online archive as a page in <a data-before="plfn" href="https://polyfen.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">Polyfen's</a> website.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Newsletter is not to push sales of our services blatantly. The goal is to provide our followers with valuable information about the industry.</p>

<p>Example</p>
<div class="preview">
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">Ever wonder why Coca-Cola is worth 260 billion? How about Apple being worth 2.65 trillion? The price of those companies shares is a direct reflection of their ability to do good Branding.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">If you were to buy 100% of shares of The Coca-Cola Company, you would be paying for all tangible assets they own (manufacturing plants, vehicles, inventory); but you would also be paying for ownership of their intangible assets, like the intellectual property of the Brand, its place in the mind of consumers, and the potential for future sales.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">Investing in your Brand (name, logo, website, social media profiles) makes your business money in three ways:</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">1. Higher Market-Share<br>A consumer faced with multiple buying options in a similar price range will always choose the most professional, trust-worthy-looking seller. Packaging what you offer with an eye-catching logo, a memorable brand name, and an elegant design will lead more buyers away from your competitors and towards your pocket.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">2. Higher Pricing<br>You‚Äôve stolen customers away from the competition. Now, they‚Äôre starting to become repeat customers, and they‚Äôre even telling their friends about your business. People are willing to pay a little extra for the guaranteed quality of your products and services. It‚Äôs time to reflect that quality in your prices with a controlled increase of the profit margin.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;">3. Higher Company Valuation<br>Investors are willing to pay a lot more money for stock in your business when you own a Brand with a distinctive name, a memorable logo, a well-crafted website, and a strong presence in social media. When calculating the value of a share from a company, the intellectual property of a Brand is a key component that could alone be worth millions of dollars.</p>

<h4 class="heading-3" id="newsletter-design">Design</h4>
<p>The design of the Newsletter template is purposefully as simple and clean as possible. It relies on color and typography to tie it in with our Brand Identity. All other aspects of the design should resemble a plain text email sent to you by a colleague. We must stay away from overly complex layouts and heavy use of visuals. Our Newsletter's strength lies in producing real, valuable content, sent to you by someone you know.</p>
