        <td><p>Travis has an Ivy League education and has 15+ years of experience in business. He was leading a bizdev team at Accenture, working on projects for Bank of America until, during the uncertain time of the COVID pandemic, he decided to use his professional experience to start a venture of his own. He bootstrapped his initial efforts investing money from his own pocket into building an MVP of a fintech app with the aid of a couple of close colleagues. He came up with a name for the company himself, posted a job on Upwork to get a quick logo done by a cheap designer, and built the website himself on Squarespace. Lastly, they put together a pitch deck and secured funding from an investor. Now they need to level up their product.</p></td>
