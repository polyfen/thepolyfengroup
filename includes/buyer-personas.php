        <td><p>Frank has an Ivy League education and has 15+ years of experience in business. He was leading a business development team at Accenture, working on projects for Nike until, during the uncertain time of the Covid pandemic, he decided to make use of his gathered professional experience to start a venture of his own. He bootstrapped his initial efforts investing money from his own pocket into developing the MVP of a fintech app. He came up with a name for his company himself, he registered the web domain of the company, he posted a job on Upwork to get a quick logo done by a cheap designer, and he created his business' website himself on Squarespace. He reached out to a few close, like-minded, experienced colleagues with whom he has worked previously on other businesses and offered them to be a part of the team.</p></td>
