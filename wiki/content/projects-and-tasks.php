    <h2 class="heading-1">6. Projects &amp; Tasks</h2>
    <p>Asana and Clockify projects follow the convention <a href="#client-code">[Client Code]</a> â€º <a href="#project-type">[Project Type]</a>.</p>
    
    <p>There are 5 stages in the workflow of any task.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="backlog">6.1. Backlog</h3>
    <p>We identify a requirement and add it to Asana as a task following SMART task practices:</p>
    <ul class="hanging-list arrow-bullet">
        <li><strong>Specific</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Measurable</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Achievable</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Relevant</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Time-bound</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="to-do">6.2. To Do</h3>
    <p>All backlog tasks that were selected for the present <a href="#sprints">Sprint</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="in-progress">6.3. In Progress</h3>
    <p>One you start work on a specific task, the first thing to do is set its status as "In Progress" to let the rest of the team know what's being worked on.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="for-review">6.4. For Review</h3>
    <p>After you consider your task is complete, add a comment with the total amount of hours worked on the task, then change the task status to "For Review" and assign the task to your reporter.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="complete">6.5. Complete</h3>
    <p>After your task is reviewed by a Reporter and approved it will be moved to the "Complete" column.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-2" id="archived">6.6. Archived</h3>
    <p>Once a week, when doing the transition between Sprint cycles, the tasks that are in the "Complete" column will be archived.</p>
